And I’ve ac­tu­al­ly checked quite some RV rental com­pa­nies to find ex­act­ly this mod­el.
But what is it that makes the Club Jok­er so spe­cial?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the Club Jok­er for the first time on the Camp­ing and Car­a­van­ing Fair 2014 in Leipzig.
Ac­tu­al­ly I was rather look­ing for sig­nif­i­cant­ly larg­er mo­torhome or car­a­van mod­el­s.
(At that time I was still think­ing that I was gonna need as much space as pos­si­ble.)
In con­trast, a mod­i­fied VW Bul­li like that is about as com­pact as you can get–although it comes with all the ameni­ties: a bed for two, kitchen, toi­let and even a show­er.
And that’s ex­act­ly what fas­ci­nates me about that car.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Whether the show­er is re­al­ly us­able for day to day use or rather some kind of emer­gen­cy hose, we’ll see.
The Club Jok­er’s fresh and grey­wa­ter tanks are rather small as well.
And for be­ing com­plete­ly func­tion­al it needs Diesel (mo­tor, heat­ing and warm wa­ter) as well as gas (s­tove) as well as elec­tric­i­ty (fridge), which com­pli­cates its use fur­ther in my opin­ion.
And how much space for pack­ing stuff is there in that thing at al­l?
It sure does­n’t look like much.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I’m nev­er­the­less check­ing it out, be­cause I’m not quite sure, how I want to live in the fu­ture.
In a mo­bile way, yes.
But does that mean to work, eat and sleep in a car?
Or do I rather want to live for short amounts of time in flats that al­ready con­tain fur­ni­ture, in what­ev­er city in the world?
Be­cause than it would pos­si­bly be suf­fi­cient to have a ve­hi­cle to trav­el from one city to the oth­er, for short va­ca­tions from time to time and to live in when there’s no short term rental avail­able.
And for such a set­ting, the Club Jok­er might be op­ti­mal.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Let’s see.
Cur­rent­ly still in a traf­fic jam near Heil­bron­n.
I’m look­ing for­ward to the car and will re­port.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By the way, please un­der­stand that there’s cur­rent­ly not a lot of im­ages or links here:
­mo­bile da­ta is ex­pen­sive.
I’ll add them lat­er.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>club joker</category><category>thoughts</category><category>vehicle</category><guid>https://timliv.es/everywhere/thoughts/homes/why-club-joker/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2016 11:35:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
