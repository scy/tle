I’m currently riding shotgun in a 1988 Mercedes E190 on our way to Bad Urach to pick up a [Westfalia Club Joker](http://www.westfalia-mobil.net/modelle/club-joker/clubjoker-wohnen.php) that we’ll use to get to paris and back.
And I’ve actually checked quite some RV rental companies to find exactly this model.
But what is it that makes the Club Joker so special?

<!-- TEASER_END -->

I’ve seen the Club Joker for the first time on the Camping and Caravaning Fair 2014 in Leipzig.
Actually I was rather looking for significantly larger motorhome or caravan models.
(At that time I was still thinking that I was gonna need as much space as possible.)
In contrast, a modified VW Bulli like that is about as compact as you can get–although it comes with all the amenities: a bed for two, kitchen, toilet and even a shower.
And that’s exactly what fascinates me about that car.

Whether the shower is really usable for day to day use or rather some kind of emergency hose, we’ll see.
The Club Joker’s fresh and greywater tanks are rather small as well.
And for being completely functional it needs Diesel (motor, heating and warm water) as well as gas (stove) as well as electricity (fridge), which complicates its use further in my opinion.
And how much space for packing stuff is there in that thing at all?
It sure doesn’t look like much.

I’m nevertheless checking it out, because I’m not quite sure, how I want to live in the future.
In a mobile way, yes.
But does that mean to work, eat and sleep in a car?
Or do I rather want to live for short amounts of time in flats that already contain furniture, in whatever city in the world?
Because than it would possibly be sufficient to have a vehicle to travel from one city to the other, for short vacations from time to time and to live in when there’s no short term rental available.
And for such a setting, the Club Joker might be optimal.

Let’s see.
Currently still in a traffic jam near Heilbronn.
I’m looking forward to the car and will report.

By the way, please understand that there’s currently not a lot of images or links here:
mobile data is expensive.
I’ll add them later.
