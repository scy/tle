If you're among the people I know personally, chances are I've already told you about my plan to move into some kind of mobile home.
I've not quite decided whether that's going to be a trailer, motorhome or even a container, but _that_ I'm gonna do it is pretty much certain.

However, there's still a huge amount of open questions: organizational, financial, legal ones--and in addition to these there are mundane ones like "am I _able_ to do that" and "is it going to make me _happy_".
Generally, I'm the kind of guy who figures out these things by himself and then simply _does_ them--but in this case, the decision is going to influence my live for a number of years.
And, above that, most likely cost a pretty penny as well.

Therefore I've decided to document my ideas, concepts, insights and experiments in public.
Because on the one hand I know of some people among my friends alone who are toying with similar thoughts and might be happy about detailed information.
On the other hand it enables me to get feedback from everywhere in the world that is going to help me with this step.

So, what (in addition to better design) can you expect on this site in the future?

<!-- TEASER_END -->

**Write-ups about experiments.**
In order to prepare for a nomadic life, I've visited the [Chaos Communication Camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chaos_Communication_Camp&oldid=676812488) last year in a camper van.
In a bit less than a week I'm going to Paris and back for 10 days in a [Westfalia Club Joker](http://www.westfalia-mobil.net/en/modelle/club-joker/clubjoker-wohnen.php).
And my plan for the summer is three weeks in Canada--in an RV, of course.
I will report in detail how it's been and what insights I've gained.

**Evaluation of different ways of mobile life.**
Right now my plan is to move into a motorhome/camper van/RV, but up until some months ago I was more thinking about a (unmotorized) _tiny home_.
Both have pros and cons, and even when you've decided for one or the other, there's still questions left like "how big" and "what kinds of features".
Or perhaps in some months my preferred dwelling is going to be a modified shipping container?
These plans and evaluations are things I want to share with you, too.

**Legal stuff.**
"Where are you going to park?" --
"What's your registered place of residence going to be?" --
"How long are you allowed to stay in a foreign country?" --
A lot of questions you have to face as a future non-standard home owner.
But I'll manage (with your help?), and I will publish the answers here.

**Recommendations.**
If your way of living is off the beaten track to a certain degree, hints from other people are twice as important.
Good campsites, helpful accessories, friendly companies or simply the best brand of mosquito repellent:
As soon as I find something, I'll let you know.

**Links.**
I'll continue to dive into the topic more and more.
Whenever there's something interesting to share, be it videos, articles, communities or something completely different, I expect to post a short article here.

**And: Your feedback.**
This blog is not supposed to become a one-way street.
If you're having feedback, get in touch.

And now have fun reading.
I'm looking forward to your responses!

This week I'll begin with posts about the camper van trip to Paris.
