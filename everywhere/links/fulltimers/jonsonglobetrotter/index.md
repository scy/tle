Thanks for the [nice feedback on Twitter](https://twitter.com/scy/status/709484759890710529) regarding the launch of this site!

Just a few hours later, somebody had already mailed me about an interesting guy who calls himself [Jonson](http://jonsonglobetrotter.de/) and the [list of vehicles he lived in since 1982(!)](http://jonsonglobetrotter.de/meine-wohnfahrzeuge/meine-wohnfahrzeuge-von-1982-2010/).
It’s certainly inspiring, thanks!
The site is in German only, but the photos tell some interesting stories all by themselves.

Tomorrow we’ll be heading to [Wohnmobile Eder](http://womo-eder.de/) (German only) in Bad Urach to pick up the Westfalia Club Joker we’ve rented for 10 days.
Then, we’re driving to Paris and back.
Expect quite a few updates in the next days!
