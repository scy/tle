And I’ve ac­tu­al­ly checked quite some RV rental com­pa­nies to find ex­act­ly this mod­el.
But what is it that makes the Club Jok­er so spe­cial?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the Club Jok­er for the first time on the Camp­ing and Car­a­van­ing Fair 2014 in Leipzig.
Ac­tu­al­ly I was rather look­ing for sig­nif­i­cant­ly larg­er mo­torhome or car­a­van mod­el­s.
(At that time I was still think­ing that I was gonna need as much space as pos­si­ble.)
In con­trast, a mod­i­fied VW Bul­li like that is about as com­pact as you can get–although it comes with all the ameni­ties: a bed for two, kitchen, toi­let and even a show­er.
And that’s ex­act­ly what fas­ci­nates me about that car.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Whether the show­er is re­al­ly us­able for day to day use or rather some kind of emer­gen­cy hose, we’ll see.
The Club Jok­er’s fresh and grey­wa­ter tanks are rather small as well.
And for be­ing com­plete­ly func­tion­al it needs Diesel (mo­tor, heat­ing and warm wa­ter) as well as gas (s­tove) as well as elec­tric­i­ty (fridge), which com­pli­cates its use fur­ther in my opin­ion.
And how much space for pack­ing stuff is there in that thing at al­l?
It sure does­n’t look like much.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;I’m nev­er­the­less check­ing it out, be­cause I’m not quite sure, how I want to live in the fu­ture.
In a mo­bile way, yes.
But does that mean to work, eat and sleep in a car?
Or do I rather want to live for short amounts of time in flats that al­ready con­tain fur­ni­ture, in what­ev­er city in the world?
Be­cause than it would pos­si­bly be suf­fi­cient to have a ve­hi­cle to trav­el from one city to the oth­er, for short va­ca­tions from time to time and to live in when there’s no short term rental avail­able.
And for such a set­ting, the Club Jok­er might be op­ti­mal.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Let’s see.
Cur­rent­ly still in a traf­fic jam near Heil­bron­n.
I’m look­ing for­ward to the car and will re­port.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By the way, please un­der­stand that there’s cur­rent­ly not a lot of im­ages or links here:
­mo­bile da­ta is ex­pen­sive.
I’ll add them lat­er.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>club joker</category><category>thoughts</category><category>vehicle</category><guid>https://timliv.es/everywhere/thoughts/homes/why-club-joker/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2016 11:35:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Link: Jonson</title><link>https://timliv.es/everywhere/links/fulltimers/jonsonglobetrotter/</link><dc:creator>Tim Weber</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scy/status/709484759890710529"&gt;nice feed­back on Twit­ter&lt;/a&gt;  re­gard­ing the launch of this site!&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Just a few hours lat­er, some­body had al­ready mailed me about an in­ter­est­ing guy who calls him­self  &lt;a href="http://jonsonglobetrotter.de/"&gt;Jon­son&lt;/a&gt;  and the  &lt;a href="http://jonsonglobetrotter.de/meine-wohnfahrzeuge/meine-wohnfahrzeuge-von-1982-2010/"&gt;list of ve­hi­cles he lived in since 1982(!)&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s cer­tain­ly in­spir­ing, thanks!
The site is in Ger­man on­ly, but the pho­tos tell some in­ter­est­ing sto­ries all by them­selves.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To­mor­row we’ll be head­ing to  &lt;a href="http://womo-eder.de/"&gt;Wohn­mo­bile Ed­er&lt;/a&gt;  (Ger­man on­ly) in Bad U­rach to pick up the West­falia Club Jok­er we’ve rent­ed for 10 days.
Then, we’re driv­ing to Paris and back­.
­Ex­pect quite a few up­dates in the next days!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>fulltimer</category><category>link</category><guid>https://timliv.es/everywhere/links/fulltimers/jonsonglobetrotter/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2016 22:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>"Tim Lives Everywhere" launches</title><link>https://timliv.es/everywhere/meta/launch/</link><dc:creator>Tim Weber</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're among the peo­ple I know per­son­al­ly, chances are I've al­ready told you about my plan to move in­to some kind of mo­bile home­.
I've not quite de­cid­ed whether that's go­ing to be a trail­er, mo­torhome or even a con­tain­er, but  &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;  I'm gonna do it is pret­ty much cer­tain.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;How­ev­er, there's still a huge amount of open ques­tion­s: or­ga­ni­za­tion­al, fi­nan­cial, le­gal ones--and in ad­di­tion to these there are mun­dane ones like "am I  &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt;  to do that" and "is it go­ing to make me  &lt;em&gt;hap­py&lt;/em&gt;".
­Gen­er­al­ly, I'm the kind of guy who fig­ures out these things by him­self and then sim­ply  &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;  them--but in this case, the de­ci­sion is go­ing to in­flu­ence my live for a num­ber of years.
And, above that, most like­ly cost a pret­ty pen­ny as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;There­fore I've de­cid­ed to doc­u­ment my ideas, con­cept­s, in­sights and ex­per­i­ments in pub­lic.
Be­cause on the one hand I know of some peo­ple among my friends alone who are toy­ing with sim­i­lar thoughts and might be hap­py about de­tailed in­for­ma­tion.
On the oth­er hand it en­ables me to get feed­back from ev­ery­where in the world that is go­ing to help me with this step.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;So, what (in ad­di­tion to bet­ter de­sign) can you ex­pect on this site in the fu­ture?&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write-ups about ex­per­i­ments.&lt;/strong&gt; 
In or­der to pre­pare for a no­madic life, I've vis­it­ed the  &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chaos_Communication_Camp&amp;amp;oldid=676812488"&gt;Chaos Com­mu­ni­ca­tion Camp&lt;/a&gt;  last year in a camper van.
In a bit less than a week I'm go­ing to Paris and back for 10 days in a  &lt;a href="http://www.westfalia-mobil.net/en/modelle/club-joker/clubjoker-wohnen.php"&gt;West­falia Club Jok­er&lt;/a&gt;.
And my plan for the sum­mer is three weeks in Canada--in an RV, of course.
I will re­port in de­tail how it's been and what in­sights I've gained.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eval­u­a­tion of dif­fer­ent ways of mo­bile life.&lt;/strong&gt; 
Right now my plan is to move in­to a mo­torhome­/­cam­per van/RV, but up un­til some months ago I was more think­ing about a (un­mo­tor­ized)  &lt;em&gt;tiny home&lt;/em&gt;.
Both have pros and con­s, and even when you've de­cid­ed for one or the oth­er, there's still ques­tions left like "how big" and "what kinds of fea­tures".
Or per­haps in some months my pre­ferred dwelling is go­ing to be a mod­i­fied ship­ping con­tain­er?
These plans and eval­u­a­tions are things I want to share with you, too.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le­gal stuff.&lt;/strong&gt; 
"Where are you go­ing to park?" --
"What's your reg­is­tered place of res­i­dence go­ing to be?" --
"How long are you al­lowed to stay in a for­eign coun­try?" --
A lot of ques­tions you have to face as a fu­ture non-­s­tan­dard home own­er.
But I'll man­age (with your help?), and I will pub­lish the an­swers here.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rec­om­men­da­tion­s.&lt;/strong&gt; 
If your way of liv­ing is off the beat­en track to a cer­tain de­gree, hints from oth­er peo­ple are twice as im­por­tan­t.
­Good camp­sites, help­ful ac­ces­sories, friend­ly com­pa­nies or sim­ply the best brand of mos­qui­to re­pel­len­t:
As soon as I find some­thing, I'll let you know.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links.&lt;/strong&gt; 
I'll con­tin­ue to dive in­to the top­ic more and more.
When­ev­er there's some­thing in­ter­est­ing to share, be it videos, ar­ti­cles, com­mu­ni­ties or some­thing com­plete­ly dif­fer­en­t, I ex­pect to post a short ar­ti­cle here.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And: Your feed­back.&lt;/strong&gt; 
This blog is not sup­posed to be­come a one-way street.
If you're hav­ing feed­back, get in touch.
Ques­tion­s? Sug­ges­tion­s? Tip­s?  &lt;a href="https://timliv.es/everywhere/contact/"&gt;Drop me a line!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;And now have fun read­ing.
I'm look­ing for­ward to your re­spons­es!
And if you're us­ing a feed read­er (I pre­fer  &lt;a href="https://www.newsblur.com/"&gt;News­Blur&lt;/a&gt;), you can  &lt;a href="https://timliv.es/everywhere/rss.xml"&gt;sub­scribe to the posts on this site&lt;/a&gt;  via RSS.
This week I'll be­gin with posts about the camper van trip to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>meta</category><category>website</category><guid>https://timliv.es/everywhere/meta/launch/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 20:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
